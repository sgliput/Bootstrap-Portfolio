## Overview

This is a portfolio of my projects and professional information, built with Bootstrap. It consists of a descriptive About Me page (Index page), a table of thumbnail links to my past projects (both deployed and on GitHub) on the Portfolio page, and a display of contact information on the Contact page. All pages are mobile-responsive.
